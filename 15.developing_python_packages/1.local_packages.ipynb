    "# Developing Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Starting a Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial on building packages in Python. Throughout this course, I'll guide you in developing your own complete Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why Build a Package?\n",
    "\n",
    "Building packages is an incredibly useful skill for any developer, regardless of the type of project you're working on. Whether you're running analysis, building machine learning models, creating data pipelines, or developing applications, packaging your code offers numerous benefits. Here's why you should build packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Packaging your code allows you to bundle it up and make it easily importable, similar to popular Python packages like numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. This eliminates the need for copying and pasting functions, classes, or code between projects, saving you time and effort.\n",
    "- **Code Organization**: By structuring your code into packages, you can avoid having multiple versions of the same code scattered across various files. Instead, you can neatly organize your code into cohesive units, making it easier to navigate and maintain.\n",
    "- **Code Sharing**: Packaging makes it simple to share your code with others. Whether you're collaborating with teammates or sharing your work with the community, packaging allows others to easily install and use your code in their own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Tutorial Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we'll cover the following topics to help you build a full-fledged Python package:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Layout**: Learn about organizing files within your package and establishing a clear structure.\n",
    "- **Import Statement Structure**: Understand how to structure import statements to expose functions and classes to users of your package.\n",
    "- **Making Your Package Installable**: Explore the process of making your package installable using tools like `setuptools` and `pip`.\n",
    "- **Including Licenses and READMEs**: Discover the importance of including licenses and README files in your package and learn how to create them.\n",
    "- **Maintaining Package Quality**: Dive into using style conventions and unit testing tools to ensure the quality and reliability of your package.\n",
    "- **Building Distributable Versions**: Learn how to create distributable versions of your package that can be easily shared with others.\n",
    "- **Package Templates**: Explore the use of package templates to speed up package development and leverage existing best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Scripts, Modules, and Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we delve deeper, let's clarify the terms we'll be using throughout this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Script**: A Python file that is designed to be run directly. Scripts typically serve a specific set of tasks and are executed from the command line or through an IDE.\n",
    "- **Module**: A Python file within a package that contains code to be imported and used by other modules or scripts. Modules allow you to organize related code into separate files for better maintainability.\n",
    "- **Package**: A directory that contains multiple Python files (modules) and may also include subdirectories (subpackages). Packages encapsulate related code and provide a namespace for organizing and accessing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Python ecosystem, the term **library** is sometimes used interchangeably with **package**. It can refer to a single package or a collection of related packages. For example, the Python standard library comprises various basic Python packages like `math`, `os`, and `datetime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Directory Tree of a Package\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the organization of Python code into a package, we'll use directory trees. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_simple_package/\n",
    "├── __init__.py\n",
    "└── simple_module.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `my_simple_package` directory represents the simplest Python package structure. It consists of two files: `__init__.py` and `simple_module.py`. The `simple_module.py` file contains the code for our package, while the `__init__.py` file is a special file that signifies to Python that this directory is a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Contents of a Simple Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the `__init__.py` file will be empty. However, this file plays a crucial role in structuring the package imports, which we'll explore later. On the other hand, the `simple_module.py` file contains the code that defines the functionality of our package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Subpackages\n",
    "\n",
    "A package directory can also contain subdirectories, known as subpackages. Let's consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_sklearn/\n",
    "├── __init__.py\n",
    "├── preprocessing/\n",
    "│   └── __init__.py\n",
    "└── regression/\n",
    "    └── __init__.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `my_sklearn` package contains two subdirectories: `preprocessing` and `regression`. Each of these subdirectories acts as a subpackage and includes its own `__init__.py` file. Utilizing subpackages helps organize your code, just as subdirectories assist in organizing your documents. It's recommended to place closely related functions and classes within the same module and group related modules within the same subpackage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have covered the introductory concepts, let's move on to the practical aspects of building Python packages."

    "# Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the importance of writing documentation for your packages and learn how to create clear and informative documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why Include Documentation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is a vital part of package development, often overlooked by developers who focus solely on writing functional code. However, good documentation plays a crucial role in enabling users to effectively utilize your code. Here's why you should include documentation in your packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usability**: Well-documented packages are easier for users to understand and use. By providing documentation for each function, class, and class method, users can access valuable information about your package's capabilities and how to interact with it. The `help()` function in Python allows users to access documentation directly from within Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Function Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, function documentation is typically included as a string at the top of each function. This string is enclosed within triple quotation marks and serves as a docstring. Let's explore the structure of function documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary**: The first sentence of the documentation acts as a summary and should read like a command, instructing the function on what to do. For simple functions, this summary may be sufficient as the entire documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Additional Information**: For more complex functions, you can provide additional information below the summary. This section may include details about the function's behavior, algorithm, or any other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Parameters**: Following the summary and additional information, you should outline the input parameters expected by the function. Each parameter should be documented with its name, followed by a colon, and its type. You can also provide a description of each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Returned Values**: The next section should list the returned values and their types, similar to how input parameters are documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Documentation Style\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing documentation, it's essential to choose a consistent style for your package. There are various standard documentation styles for Python, and in this tutorial, we'll follow the NumPy style. The NumPy style is widely used in scientific Python packages like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. It provides a verbose format suitable for documenting complex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. NumPy Documentation Style\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NumPy documentation style, section headings are indicated using underscores. Let's examine an example function's documentation in the NumPy style:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def numpy_dot_sum(array: Union[np.ndarray, List[List[float]]]) -> float:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Compute the sum of elements in a given array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    ----------\n",
    "    array : array-like\n",
    "        Input array for sum computation. It can be a numpy array, a list, or a nested list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "    -------\n",
    "    float\n",
    "        Sum of all elements in the input array.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return np.sum(array)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, the documentation includes clear sections for parameters and returned values. Multiple options for parameter types or valid values can be listed. Following this style consistently throughout your package enhances its readability and user-friendliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Package, Subpackage, and Module Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to function documentation, it's essential to provide documentation for the package, subpackages, and modules within your package. This documentation helps users navigate your package and gain a better understanding of its capabilities. Here's how to include package, subpackage, and module documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Package Documentation**: Place a summary of the package at the top of the package's `__init__.py` file. This summary should provide an overview of the package's purpose and functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subpackage Documentation**: Include a summary of each subpackage at the top of its respective `__init__.py` file. These summaries should highlight the specific functionalities of each subpackage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Module Documentation**: Write documentation at the top of each module file, summarizing its purpose and functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing clear documentation at each level, users can easily understand your package's structure and effectively utilize its features."

    "## 7. Example: Writing with Pyment\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyment is a useful tool that helps you adhere to standard documentation styles and ensures consistency throughout your package. In this exercise, you'll learn how to use Pyment to create clear and informative documentation for your functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Pyment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyment is a command-line tool that generates docstring templates for your functions and classes. It supports multiple documentation styles, including the popular NumPy style. By using Pyment, you can save time and effort in writing and formatting docstrings, while also ensuring that your documentation follows established conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, let's make sure Pyment is installed in your Python environment. You can install Pyment using pip or conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyment\n",
    "conda install pyment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you're ready to use Pyment to generate documentation templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating NumPy-Style Documentation with Pyment\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you have a Python function that needs documentation. We'll use Pyment to generate a NumPy-style docstring template for this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function greets the given name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    ----------\n",
    "    name : str\n",
    "        The name of the person to greet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "    -------\n",
    "    str\n",
    "        The greeting message.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the NumPy-style documentation template for this function, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Navigate to the directory where your Python file is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pyment --overwrite -w --output-format=numpy your_module.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Replace `your_module.py` with the actual name of your Python file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `--overwrite` option tells Pyment to overwrite the existing docstrings in the file.\n",
    "   - The `-w` option tells Pyment to modify the file in-place.\n",
    "   - The `--output-format=numpy` option specifies the desired documentation style (NumPy style in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyment will update the function's docstring with a template that follows the NumPy documentation style. Here's an example of the updated function with the generated template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Greet the given name.\n",

    "    name : str\n",
    "        The name of the person to greet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns\n",
    "    -------\n",
    "    str\n",
    "        The greeting message.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now fill in the template with detailed descriptions and additional information about the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Other Documentation Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to switch to a different documentation style later, Pyment can help you translate your existing documentation. Here's an example of translating the documentation from the NumPy style to the Google docstyle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Navigate to the directory where your Python file is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pyment --overwrite -w --output-format=google your_module.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Replace `your_module.py` with the actual name of your Python file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `--overwrite` option tells Pyment to overwrite the existing docstrings in the file.\n",
    "   - The `-w` option tells Pyment to modify the file in-place.\n",
    "   - The `--output-format=google` option specifies the desired documentation style (Google docstyle in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyment will update the function's docstring to adhere to the Google documentation style. You can then review and edit the translated docstring as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",

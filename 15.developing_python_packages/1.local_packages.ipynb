    "# Developing Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Starting a Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial on building packages in Python. Throughout this course, I'll guide you in developing your own complete Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why Build a Package?\n",
    "\n",
    "Building packages is an incredibly useful skill for any developer, regardless of the type of project you're working on. Whether you're running analysis, building machine learning models, creating data pipelines, or developing applications, packaging your code offers numerous benefits. Here's why you should build packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Packaging your code allows you to bundle it up and make it easily importable, similar to popular Python packages like numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. This eliminates the need for copying and pasting functions, classes, or code between projects, saving you time and effort.\n",
    "- **Code Organization**: By structuring your code into packages, you can avoid having multiple versions of the same code scattered across various files. Instead, you can neatly organize your code into cohesive units, making it easier to navigate and maintain.\n",
    "- **Code Sharing**: Packaging makes it simple to share your code with others. Whether you're collaborating with teammates or sharing your work with the community, packaging allows others to easily install and use your code in their own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Tutorial Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we'll cover the following topics to help you build a full-fledged Python package:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Layout**: Learn about organizing files within your package and establishing a clear structure.\n",
    "- **Import Statement Structure**: Understand how to structure import statements to expose functions and classes to users of your package.\n",
    "- **Making Your Package Installable**: Explore the process of making your package installable using tools like `setuptools` and `pip`.\n",
    "- **Including Licenses and READMEs**: Discover the importance of including licenses and README files in your package and learn how to create them.\n",
    "- **Maintaining Package Quality**: Dive into using style conventions and unit testing tools to ensure the quality and reliability of your package.\n",
    "- **Building Distributable Versions**: Learn how to create distributable versions of your package that can be easily shared with others.\n",
    "- **Package Templates**: Explore the use of package templates to speed up package development and leverage existing best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Scripts, Modules, and Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we delve deeper, let's clarify the terms we'll be using throughout this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Script**: A Python file that is designed to be run directly. Scripts typically serve a specific set of tasks and are executed from the command line or through an IDE.\n",
    "- **Module**: A Python file within a package that contains code to be imported and used by other modules or scripts. Modules allow you to organize related code into separate files for better maintainability.\n",
    "- **Package**: A directory that contains multiple Python files (modules) and may also include subdirectories (subpackages). Packages encapsulate related code and provide a namespace for organizing and accessing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Python ecosystem, the term **library** is sometimes used interchangeably with **package**. It can refer to a single package or a collection of related packages. For example, the Python standard library comprises various basic Python packages like `math`, `os`, and `datetime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Directory Tree of a Package\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the organization of Python code into a package, we'll use directory trees. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_simple_package/\n",
    "├── __init__.py\n",
    "└── simple_module.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `my_simple_package` directory represents the simplest Python package structure. It consists of two files: `__init__.py` and `simple_module.py`. The `simple_module.py` file contains the code for our package, while the `__init__.py` file is a special file that signifies to Python that this directory is a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Contents of a Simple Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the `__init__.py` file will be empty. However, this file plays a crucial role in structuring the package imports, which we'll explore later. On the other hand, the `simple_module.py` file contains the code that defines the functionality of our package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Subpackages\n",
    "\n",
    "A package directory can also contain subdirectories, known as subpackages. Let's consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_sklearn/\n",
    "├── __init__.py\n",
    "├── preprocessing/\n",
    "│   └── __init__.py\n",
    "└── regression/\n",
    "    └── __init__.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `my_sklearn` package contains two subdirectories: `preprocessing` and `regression`. Each of these subdirectories acts as a subpackage and includes its own `__init__.py` file. Utilizing subpackages helps organize your code, just as subdirectories assist in organizing your documents. It's recommended to place closely related functions and classes within the same module and group related modules within the same subpackage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have covered the introductory concepts, let's move on to the practical aspects of building Python packages."

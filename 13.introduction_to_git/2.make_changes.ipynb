    "## How Git Stores Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Git stores data using a directed acyclic graph structure called the **commit graph**. Each commit represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time. The commit graph records the entire history of the project, allowing you to navigate and track changes effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "            commit A                    commit B\n",
    "         ┌───────────┐               ┌───────────┐\n",
    "         │   File1   │               │   File1   │\n",
    "         └───────────┘               └───────────┘\n",
    "\n",
    "                ↓                            ↓\n",
    "\n",
    "            commit C                    commit D\n",
    "         ┌───────────┐               ┌───────────┐\n",
    "         │   File1   │               │   File1   │\n",
    "         │   File2   │               │   File2   │\n",
    "         └───────────┘               └───────────┘\n",

    "## Essential Commands for Comparing Files and Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Files at Different Times\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare files between different commits, you can use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git diff`: Displays the differences between the current state and the previous commit. It highlights added, modified, and deleted lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git diff <commit1> <commit2> <filename>`: Compares a specific file between two commits, `<commit1>` and `<commit2>`. It shows the differences in the specified file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Repositories at Different Times\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare repositories or branches at different times, you can use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git log`: Shows the commit history, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message. It helps you navigate and identify specific points in the project's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git log --oneline`: Provides a compact summary of the commit history, displaying only the commit hash and message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`: Compares the differences between two commits. It shows the changes needed to transform the state of `<commit1>` into `<commit2>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restoring Earlier Versions of Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Git offers several methods to restore earlier versions of files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git checkout <commit> <file>`: Restores a specific file to the state it had in `<commit>`. The file will be updated in your working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git reset <commit>`: Moves the current branch pointer to `<commit>`, discarding commits after that point. Use with caution, as it modifies the commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git revert <commit>`: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in `<commit>`. It's a safer option as it keeps the commit history intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands enable you to restore files to earlier versions or navigate to specific points in the project's history."

    "## The HEAD Shortcut\n",
    "To refer to the current commit or branch, we can use the `HEAD` shortcut. By appending a tilde (~) and a number, we can reference previous commits. For example, `HEAD~1` refers to the commit before the current one, and `HEAD~2` refers to the commit before that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Commit Hash to HEAD\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates how `HEAD` maps to different commits. The latest commit is referenced with `HEAD`, the one before that with `HEAD~1`, and the one before that with `HEAD~2`.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Using HEAD with git show\n",
    "To view changes made in a specific commit, we can use the `git show` command with `HEAD` and the tilde notation. For example, `git show HEAD~3` shows the changes in the fourth most recent commit. The output provides information such as the commit hash, author, date, log message, and diff, giving us insights into the modifications made.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Viewing Changes Between Commits\n",
    "Let's consider an example where we want to compare the changes between the fourth and third most recent commits:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git diff <commit-hash-4> <commit-hash-3>\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git diff HEAD~3 HEAD~2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will display the differences between the two commits, highlighting added, modified, and deleted lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changes per Document by Line\n",
    "To track changes made to specific lines of a file and view associated metadata, we can use the `git annotate` command followed by the filename. This can be useful when collaborating with a large team, allowing us to see who made changes to specific lines and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "To summarize, here are the commands we covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git show`: Used with `HEAD` and tilde notation to show changes in a specific commit.\n",
    "- `git diff <commit-hash1> <commit-hash2>`: Displays changes between two commits.\n",
    "- `git diff`: Can be used with different `HEAD` paths to compare the staging area with the last commit.\n",
    "- `git annotate <file>`: Shows line-by-line changes to a file and associated metadata.\n"

    "# Undoing Changes Before Committing\n",
    "\n",
    "In Git, there are several ways to undo changes before committing them. Let's explore these scenarios and learn how to use Git commands to resolve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Unstaging a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a repository with four files, and we have been modifying three of them. We want to save two of the files and continue working on the third file, `change-this.csv`, without committing it. However, we accidentally added this file to the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "To unstage the file and remove it from the staging area, we can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reset HEAD change-this.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command removes the file from the staging area, making it unstaged and bringing it back to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Making a Commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the file has been unstaged, we can proceed to commit the two modified files from the staging area using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"Commit message\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This commits the changes made to the staged files, creating a new commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Committing the Third File\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are free to update `change-this.csv`, add it back to the staging area, and make a separate commit specifically for this file. First, stage the file using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add change-this.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, commit the file with a descriptive message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"Commit message for change-this.csv\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a separate commit for the third file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Unstaging a Single File in Git\n",
    "\n",
    "To unstage a single file, we can use the command `git reset HEAD` followed by the filename. For example, to unstage `change-this.csv`, use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reset HEAD change-this.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After unstaging the file, you can edit it, restage it, and make a commit for that file only, including a log message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Unstaging All Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if we need to move all files in the staging area back to the repository, we can execute `git reset HEAD` without specifying any filenames:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reset HEAD\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command unstages all files, bringing them back to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Undo Changes to an Unstaged File\n",
    "\n",
    "If we need to undo changes to a file, let's say `change-this.csv`, that we haven't added to the staging area, we can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -- change-this.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command reverts the file back to the version in the last commit. It effectively undoes the changes made to the file. Be cautious when using `checkout` on a staged file, as it will discard the changes made before staging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Undo Changes to All Unstaged Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To undo changes to all unstaged files in the repository, we can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command should be executed from the main directory of the repository. It reverts all unstaged files in the current directory and its subdirectories to the state of the last commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Unstaging and Undoing Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "To unstage one or more files and then undo changes, we can combine the commands we have learned. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unstage all files using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git reset HEAD\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Execute the following command to undo changes and revert all file versions to the last commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git checkout .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add all files to the staging area:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "    git add .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make a commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Undo changes and revert to last commit\"\n",
    "   ```"

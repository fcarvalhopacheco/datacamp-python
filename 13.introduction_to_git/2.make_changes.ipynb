    "## How Git Stores Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Git stores data using a directed acyclic graph structure called the **commit graph**. Each commit represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time. The commit graph records the entire history of the project, allowing you to navigate and track changes effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "            commit A                    commit B\n",
    "         ┌───────────┐               ┌───────────┐\n",
    "         │   File1   │               │   File1   │\n",
    "         └───────────┘               └───────────┘\n",
    "\n",
    "                ↓                            ↓\n",
    "\n",
    "            commit C                    commit D\n",
    "         ┌───────────┐               ┌───────────┐\n",
    "         │   File1   │               │   File1   │\n",
    "         │   File2   │               │   File2   │\n",
    "         └───────────┘               └───────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the commit graph consists of four commits. Each commit points to a specific snapshot of files in the project.\n",

    "## Essential Commands for Comparing Files and Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Files at Different Times\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare files between different commits, you can use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git diff`: Displays the differences between the current state and the previous commit. It highlights added, modified, and deleted lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git diff <commit1> <commit2> <filename>`: Compares a specific file between two commits, `<commit1>` and `<commit2>`. It shows the differences in the specified file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Repositories at Different Times\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare repositories or branches at different times, you can use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git log`: Shows the commit history, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message. It helps you navigate and identify specific points in the project's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git log --oneline`: Provides a compact summary of the commit history, displaying only the commit hash and message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`: Compares the differences between two commits. It shows the changes needed to transform the state of `<commit1>` into `<commit2>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restoring Earlier Versions of Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Git offers several methods to restore earlier versions of files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git checkout <commit> <file>`: Restores a specific file to the state it had in `<commit>`. The file will be updated in your working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git reset <commit>`: Moves the current branch pointer to `<commit>`, discarding commits after that point. Use with caution, as it modifies the commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git revert <commit>`: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in `<commit>`. It's a safer option as it keeps the commit history intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands enable you to restore files to earlier versions or navigate to specific points in the project's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Example: Restoring a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a real-world example where you want to restore a file to an earlier version using Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check the commit history using `git log --oneline` to find the commit that contains the desired version of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `git checkout <commit> <file>` to restore the file. Replace `<commit>` with the commit hash and `<file>` with the filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git checkout abc123 File.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command replaces the current version of `File.txt` with the version from commit `abc123`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Verify that the file has been restored to the desired version by inspecting its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cat File.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The content\n",
    "\n",
    " should reflect the state of `File.txt` at commit `abc123`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding Git's data storage, essential commands for comparing files and repositories, and the process for restoring earlier versions of files, you can effectively manage and track changes in your data projects."

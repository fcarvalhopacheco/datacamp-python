    "## 1. Levels of settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - To view the list of customizable settings, run `git config --list`.\n",
    "   - Git has three levels of settings:\n",
    "     - Local: Use `--local` to see settings for a specific project. Local settings override global settings.\n",
    "     - Global: Use `--global` to view settings for all projects. Global settings take precedence over system settings.\n",
    "     - System: Use `--system` to display settings for every user on the computer. System settings are overridden by local and global settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What can we configure?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Run `git config --list` to view all customizable settings.\n",
    "   - Commonly customized settings are `user.email` and `user.name`, which are essential for commands requiring credentials (global settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Changing our settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Modify a global setting using `git config --global setting value`.\n",
    "    - For example, to change the email address to \"johnsmith@datacamp.com\", execute:\n",
    "     \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global user.email johnsmith@datacamp.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - To change the username to \"John Smith\", use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global user.name 'John Smith'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Note the use of single quotations to capture the full name.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Using an alias:\n",
    "   - Set up an alias through global settings to speed up common commands.\n",
    "   - For example, create an alias \"c-i\" for committing files with a log message instead of \"commit\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global alias.ci commit -m\n",
    "```\n",
    "   - Now, you can commit files with a log message using `git ci` instead of `git commit -m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Creating a custom alias:\n",
    "    - Create a custom alias for any frequently used command.\n",
    "    - For example, create an alias \"unstage\" for the command \"reset HEAD\":\n",
    "      \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Tracking aliases:\n",
    "    - Git stores aliases in the `.gitconfig` file.\n",
    "    - To view the aliases and their assigned commands, use:\n",
    "     \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global --list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This command displays the list of aliases and their corresponding original commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Ignoring specific files:\n",
    "   - Create a file called `.gitignore` to instruct Git to ignore certain files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Ignoring specific files:\n",
    "    - Inside the `.gitignore` file, add patterns for files you want to ignore.\n",
    "    - For example, add `*.log` to ignore any files ending with `.log`.\n",
    "    - You can use a text editor like `vi` to add the patterns:\n",
    "      \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vi .gitignore\n",
    "```\n",
    "      Add `*.log` to the file and save it."

    "# Working with Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -b new_branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Why Switch Branches?\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching between branches is crucial when working on projects with different components or tasks. It allows us to make progress concurrently and keep our work organized. For example, let's consider a scenario where we want to test new ideas without modifying the existing code. We can create a new branch called `testing` to work on these ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we encounter errors or need to debug code, we can create a separate branch called `debugging` to analyze logs, make changes, refactor code, and test in a staging environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Switching Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch between branches in Git, we use the `git checkout` command. If we want to switch to an existing branch, we simply run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout branch_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to switch to the `debugging` branch, we would execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout debugging\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm that we have successfully switched branches, we can use the `git branch` command. The branch we are currently in will be indicated by an asterisk (*) in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Merging Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging branches is the process of incorporating changes from one branch into another, typically merging a feature branch back into the main branch. Here's how we can merge branches in Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge source_branch destination_branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to merge the `summary-statistics` branch into `main`, we would execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge summary-statistics main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the merge command provides valuable information about the merge:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Merge made by the 'fast-forward' method.\n",
    " summary/summary.txt | 44 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++-----------\n",
    " results/summary.txt | 0\n",
    " 2 files changed, 34 insertions(+), 10 deletions(-)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output includes the commit hashes of the last two commits from each branch, the type of merge performed (e.g., fast-forward merge), and details about the changes made. It shows the number of lines added or deleted per file and lists the modified files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to work with branches in Git is essential for managing projects effectively. By switching between branches and merging changes, you can work on multiple tasks simultaneously and keep your main branch up to date with the latest changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, branches allow for concurrent development, isolation of features, and organized collaboration. Use the `git checkout` command to switch branches and the `git merge` command to combine branches."

    "# Handling Conflicts in Git\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now explore how to handle conflicts that may arise when merging branches in Git. We'll learn what conflicts are, how to resolve them, and strategies to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is a Conflict?\n",
    "\n",
    "A conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches into a single version. It happens when the same file has conflicting modifications in different branches. For example, consider a to-do list file in the main branch with two tasks. If we switch to a new branch called `update` and add a third task to the list, conflicts can arise when merging these branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempting to merge conflicting branches will result in Git notifying us of the conflict and asking us to resolve it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Attempting to Merge a Conflict\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what happens when we try to merge conflicting branches using Git's merge command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge update main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If conflicts exist between the `update` and `main` branches, Git will be unable to automatically merge them. Instead, it will ask us to fix the conflicts and commit the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Resolving Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve conflicts, we need to manually edit the conflicting file. Git helps us identify the conflicting parts by adding special markings to the file. We can use a text editor, such as `vim or nvim` =), to open the file and resolve the conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the file, we'll see Git's conflict markers, which indicate the conflicting sections. These markers include lines with arrows, equal signs, and branch names. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "<<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "Existing content in the main branch\n",
    "=======\n",
    "Additional content in the update branch\n",
    ">>>>>>> update\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The lines between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` contain the version from the current branch (`main` in this case). The lines between `=======` and `>>>>>>> update` contain the version from the conflicting branch (`update` in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve the conflict, we need to edit the file and choose which version or modifications to keep. We can remove the conflict markers and unwanted lines to create the desired final version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Merging the Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have resolved the conflict by editing the file, we need to stage and commit the changes. Here's how to complete the merge after resolving the conflict:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add conflicted_file.txt\n",
    "git commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can try to merge the branches again:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge update main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the conflict has been resolved successfully, Git will inform us that the branches are already up to date. This indicates a successful merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Avoiding Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevention is key when it comes to handling conflicts in Git. While conflicts can still occur, it's best to minimize their chances. Here are some strategies to avoid conflicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use specific branches for specific tasks**: Assign each branch to a specific task or feature to minimize conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoid simultaneous modifications to the same file**: If multiple branches need to modify the same file, coordinate and plan the changes to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these strategies, we can reduce the risk of conflicts and ensure smoother collaboration among team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflicts are an inevitable part of working with branches in Git. In this tutorial, we learned how conflicts occur when merging branches with conflicting modifications. We explored the process of resolving conflicts by manually editing the conflicting file and choosing the desired final version. Additionally, we discussed strategies to avoid conflicts by using specific branches for specific tasks and coordinating file modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling conflicts is an important skill in Git, and by understanding the process and strategies, you can effectively manage conflicts and ensure the smooth progression of your projects."
